# Akavir-Tweaks
Apparently permissions on the [base mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107667) allow for patching.

[Legacy version 1.4.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50253) patch:
* updates strings in scripts to be in English
* allows user to control quest startup, not just the first time you go to sleep

Current version patch:
* move localizable strings from script to plugin to simplify creation of translations
* allows user to control quest startup, not just the first time you go to sleep
